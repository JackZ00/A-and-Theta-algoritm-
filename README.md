# A-and-Theta-algoritm-
## RUN

  1. First run *mapCreating.py*

     Create a 50x50 map and have 10% of the squares blocked. The newly generated map file will be written to mapfile/mapcreate.txt

â€‹	2. Then run *draw2.py* 

		The program will pop up two windows (the second small window may be under the first one, please move the large window to see the small window).
In the first large window:
Red dots:   are the initial point and the goal point.
Red line:    is the shortest path
Blue dot:   can be controlled by the up, down, left and right keys of the keyboard to move. And the "get value" button in the small window can show the g(n) and h(n) values
